15 July 2016Minister of Communications Ms Faith Muthambi will give a keynote address at the Tshikona Dance and Music Annual Cultural Event on the 16th of July 2016 in Saulsville, Pretoria. The South African cultural dance and music industry is a hive of innovation and creative talent, consisting of hundreds of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs who make a living and create employment through their artistic and cultural expression.The Department of Communications, together with the Department of Arts and Culture, are closely working together to foster growth in the traditional dance and music industry. I salute those responsible for initiating this Dance and Music Annual Cultural celebration. Music and dance encompass and convey cultural traditions and values. Events of this nature become a vehicle to self-realization and remind us of who we are as a people and where we come from. These are all important elements in achieving our future goals and ambitions as a people and a country, said Muthambi.Details for the event: Date: Saturday 16 July 2016 Venue: Saulsville Arena, Pretoria Time: 10h00Enquiries: Mish Molakeng Cell: 082 469 3997Issued by Government Communications (GCIS) on behalf of the Ministry of Communications
