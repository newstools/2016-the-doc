7 July 2016Minister of Communications Ms Faith Muthambi will on the 9th of July 2016 re-open four classrooms that were destroyed by a storm at Peninghotsa High School, in Mhinga Village, Limpopo.The reroofing, and refurbishing of the school was made possible by the MTN Foundation South Africa and the SABC Foundation. I made a commitment to Peninghotsa learners in January this year that I will come back to refurbish the classrooms and fix the roof. I m here today, to honour that promise. As we celebrate Mandela Month this July, it is fitting to be here to give back to the community of Mhinga, and by so doing, it promotes the legacy of Nelson Mandela, said Muthambi.Details for the event: Date: 9th of July, 2016 Time: 07:30 Venue: Peninghotsa High, Mhinga VillageEnquiries: Mish Molakeng Cell: 082 469 3997 Issued by GCIS on behalf of the Ministry of Communications
