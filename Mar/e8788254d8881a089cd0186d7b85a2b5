7 Mar 2016Department of Communications to Present Broadcasting Amendment Bill before Portfolio Committee on CommunicationsThe Department of Communications will present the Broadcasting Amendment Bill before Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Communications on Tuesday the 8th March, 2016. Last November the Cabinet approved the amendments to the Broadcasting Act, 1999 (Act No 4 of 1999) for submission to Parliament. This Bill does not create a new regulatory regime, but seeks to strengthen corporate governance which ensures the long-term stability and sustainability of the SABC. One of the proposed changes in the Bill, is to reduce the number of non-executive Board members from twelve to nine. The rational for this change is to strengthen the Board and to streamline its operations. Further to that, the proposed amendments to the Broadcasting Act, are in line with our vision of ensuring universal access to broadcasting services in South Africa. The proposed changes will strengthen the SABC positioning and allow it to fulfil its public broadcasting service mandate. The Department of Communications invites all interested parties to participate in the Parliamentary processes to deliberate on the proposed amendments to the Bill.Enquiries: Mish Molakeng Cell: 082 469 3997 Issued by Department of Communications
