31 May 2016The registration for the Set-top-Boxes for Broadcasting Digital Migration moved to another level in April when the department decided to kick-start door to door registration process for qualifying indigent households. Qualifying residents of Kwaggafontein in Mpumalanga are set to be the latest beneficiaries of government-subsidised set-top-boxes.Minister of Communications Ms Faith Muthambi will, this Friday, oversee the registration of community members of Kwaggafontein for the set-top-boxes that will enable them to enjoy an improved television watching experience. This is part of government s broadcasting digital migration programme.The door-to-door registration is particularly aimed at the elderly and disabled, as well as those qualifying families who, for credible reasons, are unable to go to their nearest Post Office for registration. This registration process will run concurrently with the registration process at the Post Office. The department will announce the analogue signal switch-off date when more than 80% of households have been migrated to the digital television platform. We are confident that we will reach 80% by end of next year, said Muthambi. In her budget vote in Parliament, Muthambi announced that the department, together with the SABC, had since resolved to delink TV licence as a requirement for the subsided set-top boxes registration process.Event details: Date: Friday, 3 June 2016 Time: 09:00 Venue: Kwaggafontien Community Hall, Thembisile Hani Local Municipality, MpumalangaEnquiries: Mish Molakeng Contact: 082 469 3997Issued by GCIS on behalf of the Ministry of Communications
