10 May 2016Good progress is being made in the migration of broadcasting services from analogue to digital TV. Minister of Communications Ms Faith Muthambi takes the broadcasting digital migration public awareness campaign to the community of Makuleke in Limpopo on the 13th of May 2016. In her budget vote in Parliament, Minister Muthambi announced that the Department of Communications, together with the management of the SABC, have since resolved to omit the TV licence requirement from the set-top- boxes subsidy registration process. Since this omission, the number of households registering for the subsidised set-top-boxes has risen significantly. The migration project is well on its way. Since the beginning of this year we have met numerous stakeholders including community members, traditional authorities and community media to inform them about the progress made and also get their input on how best we can implement this important project. We are taking advice on board, and the omission of TV licences as a requirements shows that we are alert and responsive to challenges that may hinder the migration project," said Muthambi.
