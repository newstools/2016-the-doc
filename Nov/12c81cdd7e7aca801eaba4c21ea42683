10 November 2016 The Minister of Communications Ms Faith Muthambi sends condolences to the family of Dr Stephen Mncube, the former chairperson of the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa), who recently passed away at the age of 76 due to ill health. Dr Mncube was appointed chairman of Icasa in 2010 and retired from this position in 2015. He took office when the broadcasting and telecommunications sectors faced daunting technological, operational and regulatory challenges. Dr Mncube’s tenure also coincided with a period when regulators across the globe came under sustained pressure to create policies that advance the interests of consumers, promote the growth and evolution of these industries while also encouraging new entrants. He made meaningful contributions to the broadcasting industry through various other leadership roles including chairmanships held in various organisations such as Sentech, The National Information Technology Forum and many others. Even after his retirement, Dr Mncube remained active and available to pass his knowledge and expertise to those who sought his wisdom. “He was one of the delegates at the Media Transformation Colloquium held by the Ministry of Communications in August this year. He contributed to the robust engagements that took place, and was an active participants in the plenary sessions of this colloquium,” said Muthambi. “We wish his family strength during this difficult time and may his soul rest in peace,” Muthambi added. Details of Dr Mncube’s funeral arrangement will be made public in the due course. Enquires:Mish MolakengCell: 082 469 3997 Issued by Department of Communications
