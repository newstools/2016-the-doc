Addressing delegates at the Nation Brand Forum which was recently hosted by Brand South Africa on August 24, 2016 - Minister of Communications Faith Muthambi said, Building a national brand depends on nation building and how cohesive we are as a nation. We are a developing country. And as such, enhanced image will create more favourable conditions to attract both domestic and foreign direct investment, tourism, trade and foster greater political relations with other countries. South Africa has a good story to tell. So let s come up with a branding that enhances our standing before the community of nations. The University Dialogue is in line with Brand South Africa s objectives of developing and implementing proactive and co-ordinated marketing, communication and reputation management strategies for South Africa. This is best achieved by building an awareness of how each citizen impacts on the Nation Brand, its reputation and perceptions associated with it, in a consistent way.A key outcome of the Dialogue will be the compilation of all the papers presented on the day in a peer reviewed academic journal, thus positioning South Africa in the thought leadership space in the field of nation branding.Media is invited to attend as follows: Date: Wednesday 5 October 2016 Time: 08h00 Venue: University of Pretoria, Senate Hall RSVPS/Enquiries: Tsabeng Nthite on 076 371 6810 /tsabengn@brandsouthafrica.com Media are kindly requested to RSVP by Monday 26 September2016 for logistical reasons.Brand South Africa will also be able to facilitate any requests for interviews.
