17 September 2016Minister of Communications Ms Faith Muthambi will deliver a keynote address at the 2016 Limpopo Sports and Recreation Awards on Saturday night, 17th of September 2016. The awards, to be held in Polokwane, recognise talented athletes who have excelled in their respective fields of sports. Supporting these awards is one of the ways through which the Ministry of Communications delivers to government s Outcome 14 programme, which aims to encourage South Africans to take up sports and foster the growth of a responsible and active citizenry. Sports teaches discipline and is an integral component of a healthy lifestyle; and also enables South Africans to share common spaces. As we know, sport was systematically segregated and underdeveloped during the apartheid years. This is changing; and these awards are a recognition of this change. Through these awards we seek to reward excellent performance and motivate others to follow in the footsteps of the great men and women being recognised tonight, said Muthambi.
