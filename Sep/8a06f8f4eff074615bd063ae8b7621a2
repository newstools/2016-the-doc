22 September 2016Minister of communications Ms Faith Muthambi will address the annual general conference of the United African Apostolic Church this coming Sunday, the 25th of September 2016, at the church's headquarters in Nzhelele. The United African Apostolic Church has more than 2 million congregants spread across the SADC region. The visit by the Minister comes as South Africa celebrates Heritage month. As we celebrate Heritage month it is important to reconnect with the institutions that are important in shaping our being - the church is one of them. This visit is to pay tribute to the church and its members, many of whom have built a firm foundation for stable and coherent communities. We know that religion, as well as our cultural norms and values, underpin the character and nature of a society. Religion and culture are integral aspects of our daily lives; and are important anchors that mould the shape and form of our societies," said Muthambi.Details of the event are as follows: Venue: United African Apostolic Church, Nzhelele Ha-Mavhunga Date: Sunday, 25 of September, 2016 Time: 9h00Enquiries: Mish Molakeng Cell: 082 469 3997 Issued by Government Communications (GCIS) on behalf of the Ministry of Communications
