22 September 2016Ministry of Communications not asked to appoint Hlaudi Motsoeneng as acting COOThe Ministry is aware of a letter purporting to be from the SABC, suggesting that the board request approval for the appointment of Hlaudi Motsoeneng as acting chief operating officer.We want to state categorically that we have not formally received such letter from the SABC Board for the Minister s consideration. As stated before, we are confident that the SABC will give due consideration to the court ruling in the case of Motsoeneng. As the shareholder representative, our duty is to wait for the SABC to engage us formally on this matter, in line with the mandate of the broadcaster.Until such time, it would be highly in appropriate for the ministry to make public pronouncements.
