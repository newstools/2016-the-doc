The results in the 2016 WEF Global Competitiveness Index indicates that South Africa is indeed resilient in the face of global headwinds and a range of other challenges. More importantly, these results confirm that we are on the right path as a nation in terms of the solutions we are implementing to strengthen our economy. The strides we are making in collectively executing the National Development Plan and 9 point plan for economic development are yielding positive results for the country and our people. Brand South Africa expresses its appreciation to all citizens of the country for your steadfast commitment to ensuring that the Nation Brand strengthens its value proposition for citizens in particular and the international community in general, concluded Dr Makhubela.According to the World Economic Forum South Africa slightly improves both its score and ranking (47th, up two). It has been relatively less affected by commodity price falls than other economies in the region, and has registered marginal improvements in almost all aspects of competitiveness. Most significant areas of progress include enhanced competition, both locally (up 13 places) and internationally (up 16 places); better use of talent in terms of how pay reflects productivity (98th, up 29 places); and a small but important upgrade in the quality of education (up five places), with primary school enrolment also now passing 97 percent. This is the latest in a series of international instruments which highlight the strengthening of the Nation Brand s competitiveness. The Institute of Management Development s Competitive Index and the World Bank s Logistics Index are amongst the indices where South Africa has improved in its performance.Notes to the EditorAbout Brand South AfricaBrand South Africa is the official marketing agency of South Africa, with a mandate to build the country's brand reputation, in order to improve its global competitiveness.
